## Requirements
Phlip requires PHP 7.1. Development depends on [PHPUnit 7](https://phpunit.de/index.html).

## Installation

### Composer

If you have already set up a [global install of Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally) just run:

```bash
$ composer global require webgraphe/phlip
```

You can also add Phlip as a dependency for your project with:

```bash
$ composer require webgraphe/phlip
```

## REPL

Global composer installation allows to use `phlip` from anywhere on your system.

In a project with Phlip as a dependency, run `vendor/bin/phlip`.

## PhlipUnit

Global composer installation allows to use `phlipunit` from anywhere on your system and to lookup `.phlip` files.

In a project with Phlip as a dependency, run `vendor/bin/phlipunit`.
